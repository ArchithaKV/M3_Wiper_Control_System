# M3_Wiper_Control_System

The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it. And the main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
